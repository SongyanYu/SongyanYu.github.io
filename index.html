	 I am a quantitative hydro-ecologist with extensive research expertise in hydrological modelling, surface water variation,
	 environmental flow management, river health assessment, and systematic conservation prioritisation. I am currently working as a
	 Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Australian Rivers Institute, Griffith University.
	 </p>
     <p>I completed my PhD in 2019 where I investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics 
	 and hydro-ecology of intermittent streams in eastern Australia. 
     My focus was on quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of flow intermittency, 
     and development and application of a predictive model for surface water extent to identify aquatic habitat refuges.</p>
