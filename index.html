     I was a PhD student at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, and recently completed my PhD thesis in May 2019.<br>
     My research investigated the hydro-ecology and functions of intermittent streams in Australia. 
     My focus was on quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of flow intermittency, 
     and development and application of a predictive model for surface water extent to identify aquatic habitat refuges. 
     I was also working on hydrological modelling with particular interests in low flow simulations.<br>
     I completed his Master of Engineering degree in the field of environmental baseflow estimation and management at Beijing Normal University, China.
     Before that he undertook a Bachelor of Engineering degree at Wuhan University, China.
