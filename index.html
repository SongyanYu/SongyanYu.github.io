     <p><font size ="+1">Songyan (Sunny; 于松延) Yu is Research Fellow at Australian Rivers Institute, Griffith University, 
	 with expertise in water science and management of catchment and lakes. He recently led a research project to investigate 
	 the health risks of purified recycled water as a supplementary water source introduced to reservoirs. 
	 His research work also involved modelling surface water availability across catchments to inform water security for 
	 freshwater biodiversity and human society under climate change. His research has been used to inform the Gold Coast City Council
	 of nutrient reduction in a recreational lake and support water utilities for climate change adaption.</font></p>
	 
     <p><font size ="+1">Songyan completed his PhD in 2019 where he investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics and hydro-ecology
	 of intermittent streams in eastern Australia. His main focus was on quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of flow intermittency,
	 and development and application of a predictive model for surface water extent to identify aquatic habitat refuges. 
	 He was also working on hydrological modelling with a particular interest on low flow simulations.</font></p>
	 
	 <p><font size ="+1">Songyan enjoys computer programming and has published an R software package – “dycdtools” 
	 – that can help lake modelers automatically calibrate a widely used 1-D lake model DYRESM-CAEDYM. The package also
	 includes several visualization functions to post-process lake model output for easy interpretation.</font></p>
