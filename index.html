     <p><font size ="+1">Hi, I'm Songyan (Sunny) Yu and my Chinese name is 于松延. I'm a scientific researcher working on rivers and lake as a Research Fellow at Australian Rivers Institute, Griffith University in Australia.
	 My research can be used to inform the management of river catchments and lakes.</font></p>
	 
	 <p><font size = '+1'>My recent research work focuses on climate change impact and adaption. I recently led a research project to model surface water availability 
	 across river catchments to inform water security for freshwater biodiversity and human society under climate change. I was also involved in a study to investigate 
	 health risks of purified recycled water as a supplementary and climate resilient water source introduced to reservoirs. My lake-related research has been used to 
	 inform the Gold Coast City Council of nutrient reduction in a recreational lake and support water utilities for climate change adaption.</font></p>
	 
     <p><font size ="+1">I also have a research interest in better understanding the hydro-ecology of non-perennial streams. This interest starts from my PhD, where I investigated
	 the spatio-temporal dynamics and hydro-ecology of non-perennial streams in eastern Australia. The focus was on quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of flow intermittency,
	 and development and application of a predictive model for surface water extent to identify aquatic habitat refuges across river networks. </font></p>
	 
	 <p><font size ="+1">I like computer programming and have recently published an R software package – “dycdtools” 
	 – that can help lake modelers automatically calibrate a widely used 1-D lake model DYRESM-CAEDYM. The package also
	 includes several visualization functions to post-process lake model output for easy interpretation.</font></p>
