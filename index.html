     I submitted my PhD thesis in May 2019 and now am working as a post-doc research fellow at Australian Rivers Institute, Griffith University.
	 </p>
     <p>My research investigated the hydro-ecology and functions of intermittent streams in Australia. 
     My focus was on quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of flow intermittency, 
     and development and application of a predictive model for surface water extent to identify aquatic habitat refuges. </p>
     
	 <p>I was also working on hydrological modelling with particular interests in low flow simulations.</p>
     <p>I completed his Master of Engineering degree in the field of environmental baseflow estimation and management at Beijing Normal University, China.
     Before that he undertook a Bachelor of Engineering degree at Wuhan University, China.
