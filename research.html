<li>I developed a new method to quantify spatial and temporal variations in streamflow intermittency throughout river networks.</li>
<br>
<li>I modelled surfaec water extent within river networks, ranging from headwaters to main stem.</li>
<br>
<li>I identified priority aquatic refuges in a systematic way to sustain biodiversity in dendritic river networks.</li>
