<h2>Research expertise</h2>

<div>
<p>Over time, I have built research expertise in environment science with two particular focuses: <b>river and lake</b>. I have been leading or invovled in
a range of research projects to apply various research tools (e.g., statistical models and aquatic ecosystem models) to inform management of river networks 
and lake ecosystems. Below is a bit detail about my research on river and lake, respectively.
</p>

<h3>1. River</h3>

<p>
My river research is focused on non-perennial streams, streams that flow for some time of a year. Non-perennial streams are less studied and understood 
compared to perennial streams, but have attracted increasing research interests over the past decades. 
</p>

<p>
One of my research direction is to find out where non-perennial streams are i.e. the spatio-temporal dynamics of flow intermittency across river networks.
You can find more detail from two of my publications:
<ul>
<li><a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.009'>Quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of flow intermittency using spatially contiguous runoff data</a></li>
<li><a href = 'https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5279-2020'>Evaluating a landscape-scale daily water balance model to support spatially continuous representation of flow intermittency throughout stream networks</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
On non-perennial streams, I am also exploring plausible methods to identify variations in surface water extent when stream flow ceases. 
When stream flow ceases, non-perennial streams are usually disconnected into a series of isolated rivering pools. 
The surface water in these pools are critical refuges for aquatic species to survive extended dry periods.
You can find more detail about my research on this area from the below publication:
<ul>
<li><a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025216'>Development and Application of Predictive Models of Surface Water Extent to Identify Aquatic Refuges in Eastern Australian Temporary Stream Networks</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The two above mentioned research questions enable us to have reasonable estimates of where non-perennial streams are and how persistent surface water is across river networks.
Building on that, I am able to propose a conservation planning strategy for biodiversity management across non-perennial river networks. 
This strategy essentially prioritises river segments with persistent surface water and other required attributes for aquatic species to survive and flourish in an non-perennial stream environment.
A paper describing this research is currently under review and will be made available once accepted for publication.
But if you feel interested in this research, you are welcome to reach out to me via email.
