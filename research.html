<p><b>Background and Challenge:</b> River channel drying caused by intermittent streamflow is a widely-recognized factor shaping stream ecosystems.
There is a strong need to quantify the distribution of intermittent streams across catchments to inform management.
However, observational gauge networks provide only point estimates of streamflow variation.</p>
<p><b>Action and Findings:</b> Here we proposed an approach to quantifying spatial and temporal variation in monthly flow intermittency 
throughout river networks in eastern Australia. We found that the degree of flow intermittency varied substantially across streams in eastern Australia, 
ranging from perennial streams flowing permanently (11-12 months) to strongly intermittent streams flowing 4 months or less of year. 
Results also showed that the temporal extent of flow intermittency varied dramatically inter-annually from 1900-2016, 
with the proportion of intermittent streams ranging in length from 3 % to nearly 100% of the river network, 
but there was no evidence of an increasing trend towards flow intermittency over this period.</p>
<p><b>Application:</b> Our approach to generating spatially explicit and catchment-wide estimates of streamflow intermittency 
can facilitate improved ecological understanding and management of intermittent streams in Australia and around the world.</p>

<p><b>Background and Challenge:</b> Many organisms living in temporary streams rely on remnant surface water to survive during extended dry periods 
and recolonize newly established habitats when flow resumes. 
However, research on the spatio-temporal variations of surface water extent for entire river networks is scarce.</p>
<p><b>Action and Findings:</b> We first propose a new field method for rapid surface water assessment. 
Next, we develop predictive models relating observed water extent to environmental attributes at a large number of surveyed stream segments (n=241) 
in eastern Australian coastal catchments. 
We use the models to predict daily variations in surface water dynamics throughout entire river networks over the period of 1911-2017, 
based on available long-term environmental attributes influencing hydrological processes. 
We find descriptors of surface water extent can be accurately predicted based on robust internal and external validations. 
Environmental predictor variables representing water gaining processes were more important in predicting surface water extent than variables representing water losses. 
Simulated long-term variations in surface water extent were highly dynamic through space and time, particularly in inland streams, 
which were predicted to be the driest on average. Total stream length with surface water ranged from 8,974 to 13,742 km across the study period. 
<p><b>Applications:</b> Our study presents a novel and practical approach to quantifying and predicting variations in surface water extent, 
with potential applicability to other parts of the world. 
The simulated surface water extent through space and time can be used to identify and prioritize potential aquatic refuge areas 
that sustain aquatic biodiversity in river networks during extended dry periods.</p>
