<h2>New research could help river managers better predict water supply issues</h2>

<p>
“We need to know which streams and rivers dry up so that we can be smarter when we predict water quality problems and also when we predict the quantity of water ending up in our water reservoirs” says Songyan (Sunny) Yu </p>

<p>Intermittent streams are those that dry up for parts of the year. Intermittent streams represent approximately 70% of headwater streams globally and their prevalence is increasing globally due to climate change and groundwater extraction.</p>

<p>It is increasingly important to know how long streams are dry for because (1) dry channels can eventually lead to severe water quality issues downstream once flow resumes and (2) water managers need a better understanding of how much water is flowing into our dams and reservoirs. </p>

<p>However, there is currently no way of accurately knowing how intermittent streams change throughout a river network and over time. This is because the primary hydrological data source, observational gauge networks, provides only point estimates of streamflow variation. Further, it is not practical to physically check all stream sections to know if they are flowing or not.</p>

<p>To address this problem, we used modelling to estimate spatial and temporal variation in flow intermittency throughout river networks using existing point estimates of flow.  We are now able to estimate changes in river flow along the entire length of a river channel rather than just at one point. And we can even look back in time and see how flow intermittency likely changed over the past century.</p>

<p>We applied this approach to south-east Queensland. We found that the degree of flow intermittency varied substantially across streams within south-east Queensland, ranging from permanently flowing to strongly intermittent streams flowing for just 4 months or less each year. The majority of coastal streams and the main channels of the major rivers permanently flowed, while most inland headwaters were weakly to strongly intermittent, particularly in the south-western part of the Brisbane River catchment.</p>

<p>Amazingly, we were able to use this approach to see how stream flow varied over 100 years ago in south-east Queensland (Figure 1). We found that the temporal extent of flow intermittency varied inter-annually from 1900-2016, with the proportion of intermittent (weakly and strongly intermittent) streams ranging in length from 3% to nearly 100% of the river network.</p>

<p>Further steps have already been taken to communicate these important findings. Sunny recently presented these important research findings at the 19th conference of the Iberian Association of Limnology in Coimbra, Portugal. Over 360 scientists attended the conference.</p>
